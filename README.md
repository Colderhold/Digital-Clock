**Digital Clock using Java**

**Description**

This project is a digital clock implementation in Java that can be integrated into a system. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the current time in a 24-hour format. The digital clock continuously updates in real-time to reflect the accurate system time.

**Features**

**Graphical User Interface:**

The digital clock has a simple and intuitive GUI.

It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

The GUI can be customized to match the system's look and feel.

**Real-time Updates:**

The clock updates in real-time to reflect the accurate system time.

It continuously refreshes the displayed time to ensure accuracy.

**24-hour Format:**

The clock displays time in a 24-hour format (00:00:00 to 23:59:59).

The hours, minutes, and seconds are formatted with leading zeros if necessary.

**Integration:**

The digital clock can be integrated into a system or application.

It can be placed in a specific location on the system's interface.

**Technologies Used**

Java: Used as the programming language for developing the digital clock.

Java Swing: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) components.

**Installation**

To run the digital clock in a Java environment, follow these steps:

Ensure that Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system. If not, download and install the latest JDK from the official Oracle website.

Clone or download the project files from the repository.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Compile the Java source file using the following command:

**javac DigitalClock.java**

Run the compiled Java class using the following command:

Copy code

**java DigitalClock**

**Usage**

Run the digital clock program using the steps mentioned in the installation section.

The digital clock GUI will be displayed on the screen.

The clock will start displaying the current time in a 24-hour format and continue updating in real-time.

Customize the GUI as per your requirements and integrate it into your system or application.
